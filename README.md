# Student-Analysis
Task 1 On Student performance data

This repository contains my work for the Maincrafts Technology Data Science Internship Task.

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the Student Performance Dataset 

using Python and demonstrate a full data science workflow:

Load → Clean → Analyze → Visualize → Conclude


All steps are documented clearly in a Jupyter Notebook using Markdown explanations.
